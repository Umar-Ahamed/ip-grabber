## Functionality
   
1.) **Installing Required Packages:**
   The script checks for the presence of the `pyperclip` package and installs it if necessary.

2.) **Getting Local IP Address:**
   The `get_local_ip()` function retrieves the local IP address using a socket connection to the Google DNS server (`8.8.8.8`).

3.) **Text Content:**
   Two sets of text content are predefined (`usernames_text` and `greeting_names_text`). You can customize these variables with your own content.

4.) **Combining Content and Local IP:**
   The script combines the `usernames_text`, local IP address, and `greeting_names_text` into a single string (`combined_output`).

5.)
**Printing and Copying to Clipboard:**
   The combined output is printed to the console, and it's also copied to the clipboard using the `pyperclip` library.
